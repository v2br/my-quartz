**Six Sigma** is a **data-driven methodology** used to improve processes by identifying and eliminating defects, reducing variation, and increasing quality and efficiency. It’s widely applied in **manufacturing, engineering, healthcare, finance, and tech** — and increasingly relevant in **project management and process improvement roles**.

## **🎯 What Is Six Sigma?**

- **Goal:** Reduce process variation and defects to **no more than 3.4 errors per million opportunities**.
    
- **Core principle:** Improve quality by removing the causes of errors and minimizing variability.
    
- **Approach:** Uses **statistical tools and process analysis** to make decisions.

## **🛠️ The Six Sigma Methodologies**

  

### **✅** 

### **DMAIC**

###  **(for improving existing processes):**

1. **Define** – Identify the problem and customer requirements
    
2. **Measure** – Gather data on current performance
    
3. **Analyze** – Find root causes of defects or variation
    
4. **Improve** – Implement and verify solutions
    
5. **Control** – Sustain improvements through monitoring

### **DMADV**

###  **(for creating new processes/products):**

1. **Define**
    
2. **Measure**
    
3. **Analyze**
    
4. **Design**
    
5. **Verify**
