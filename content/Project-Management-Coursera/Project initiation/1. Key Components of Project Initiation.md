- Goals: What you're trying to achieve, often determined by senior leaders with your input.
- Scope: Defining the work required to complete the project.

**Deliverables and Success Criteria**

- Deliverables: Tangible or intangible products/services created for the client, contributing to project goals (e.g., a manuscript chapter, staff training).
- Success Criteria: Standards for measuring how well the project achieved its goals.

**Stakeholders and Resources**

- Stakeholders: People interested in and affected by the project's success, crucial for decision-making. They help determine goals, deliverables, and success criteria.
- Resources: Budget, personnel, materials, and other items available for the project. Careful consideration of resources is vital for project completion. A project charter documents all the project details and is reviewed with stakeholders before moving to the planning phase.
