To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

- Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements
    
- Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects
    
- Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project
## **What is important to the customers or stakeholders**

- Evaluating user engagement with the product 
    
- Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys
    
- Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data


Success Criteria Template 

  

Defining success criteria tells you whether or not the project was successful. As a best practice, use a template like the one below to help you record, document and align stakeholders on key project components.
