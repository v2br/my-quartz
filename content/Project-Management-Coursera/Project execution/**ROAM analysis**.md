**What ROAM stands for:**

- **R**esolved - Issues that have been addressed and closed
- **O**wned - Issues assigned to someone who will handle them
- **A**ccepted - Risks acknowledged but accepted (no action planned)
- **M**itigated - Risks being actively managed or reduced

**How it works:** ROAM analysis categorizes risks, issues, or decisions into these four buckets to ensure nothing falls through the cracks and everyone knows the status and ownership.

**When to use ROAM:**

- Project management and risk assessment
- Team meetings and status updates
- Decision-making processes
- Issue tracking and resolution

**Benefits:**

- Clear accountability (who owns what)
- Transparent risk management
- Prevents issues from being ignored
- Facilitates team communication
- Helps prioritize attention and resources

**Example application:** In a software project:

- **Resolved**: Fixed the login bug
- **Owned**: Sarah is handling the database migration
- **Accepted**: We accept the risk of minor UI inconsistencies for now
- **Mitigated**: Added extra testing to reduce deployment risks

**Alternative frameworks:** Some organizations use variations like RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) or other risk management methodologies.
