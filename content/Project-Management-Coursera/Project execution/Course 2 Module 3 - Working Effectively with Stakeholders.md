## Exploring project team roles and responsibilities
#### Accessibility, for project managers
ArikReview
Over one billion people have a disability, and many disabilities are not immediately visible.
When you create solutions for persons with disabilities, you are not only serving the critical audience of people with permanent disabilities, you are also unlocking secondary benefits for everyone who may move in and out of disability over time. 

Examples of accessibility we don't immediately think about:
- mobile voice assistant
- speech to text
- closed captions
...And ones that have become commonplace!
- remote control
- typewriter/keyboard
- office scanner
- SMS text messages
- elevator

The fact that they included this makes me happy and hopeful.

#### Choosing the right team

Consider...
- Required roles
- Team size
- Necessary skills - these can be taught, but make sure it is done in a timely fashion!
- Availability
- Motivation - surprising, but important!

Fixed Roles:
- Project sponsor
- Team member
- User
- Stakeholder
- Project manager - you!

A project sponsor initiates the project and is responsible for presenting a business case for its existence. 
	They advocate for alignment with senior management, advise on key business decisions, and approve budget and resources.

It's important to understand *people* in *context*. 

"The most important part of program management is understanding the personalities of the people you work with so that you can tailor your approach to make sure you're working effectively with them."
This is why it's important to have a flexible approach!

## Evaluating Stakeholders

Stakeholders range from active to passive depending on the project, and steering committees may not be necessary for all of them.

Completing a Stakeholder Analysis:
1. Make a list of all the stakeholders that the project impacts
2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
3. Assess stakeholders' ability to participate and then find ways to involve them
==Interest refers to how much the stakeholder's needs are affected by the project operations and outcomes

The important of a stakeholder depends on how high their interest and influence is. Those with the highest are called ==key stakeholders==, without whose help the project would be unlikely to successfully land.

A "power grid" can help plan how to best manage stakeholders.

| ^^^       | 2        | 1   |
| --------- | -------- | --- |
| influence | 4        | 3   |
|           | interest | >>> |
1) Key stakeholders; collaborate with them closely.
2) High influence, low interest; meet their needs. (i.e. Director of Product)
3) High interest, low influence; show consideration for them. (i.e. customer success team)
4) Low influence, low interest; they still matter! They're just less integral to the daily process. You just want to monitor them.

The key stakeholders with the most influence *and* interest typically have the power to change the budget and approve updates to the timeline or scope. They are Big Boss. 

While they aren't part of the steering committee, the PM is responsible for gathering and providing all the necessary information for decisions to be made quickly.

**Stakeholder buy-in**
	The process of involving stakeholders in the project's decision making with the goal of reaching a broader consensus on the organization's future.
This requires different styles of engagement and involvement depending on the person and situation, so choose accordingly.

Tips for gaining buy-in:
- Clearly mapping out the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder
- Describing how the project aligns with their goals
- Listening to feedback and finding ways to incorporate it into the project's charter where appropriate
Suggested questions for stakeholders:
- What are your top priorities/goals?
- How will this initiative/project support you and your goals?
- What role would you like to play in this project?
- Here's how I plan to keep people informed... Does that work for you?
- What can I clarify?
- What are your expectations? What would you like this project to accomplish?
- What does success look like for you?
- Anyone else you would recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
- What info or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
- Where do you see me getting support or running into resistance?
- Any additional thoughts or questions?

## Assigning project team roles and responsibilities

RACI charts help define roles and responsibilities to ensure that work gets done efficiently.
	**R**esponsible - those doing the work to complete the task
	**A**countable - those making sure the work gets done
	**C**onsulted - those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision makers
	**I**nformed - those just needing to know the final decisions
You must write down each task and assign it the appropriate role for each stakeholder, like so:

|              | individual- | roles |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----- |
| tasks and    | R           | A     |
| deliverables | C           | I     |
Tasks listed in the first column, and roles dispersed in the cells based on level of engagement.
Better to use roles rather than names usually, as people may have multiple roles.

==This is confusing. Reading page right after the video places RACI as the columns and the roles in the fields. This module also does not distinguish "roles" in the contexts of RACI roles and the actual roles within the project, so that's confusing.

There will only be one person designated as "accountable" for any given task. This helps prevent confusion and clearly defines ownership. But one person can be accountable and responsible!

Potential confusion: How do you handle unbalanced workloads? Who do people seek help from when something doesn't get done? Who makes the final call on a project? How do you prevent or resolve overlap?

It's important to keep communication clear *and* concise, and sometimes even limit it, as overcommunication can create overload and overcomplicate things.

Ways to define roles:
	Responsible - doing the work
		What department does the work fall under?
		Who performs the work?
	Accountable - helpful to separate from responsible when possible
		Who will delegate the task to be completed?
		Who will review the work to to determine if the task is completed?
	Consulted - communicate frequently with responsible 
		Who will the task impact?
		Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
	Informed - possible to have many people assigned this role
		Who cares about this tasks completion?
		Who will be affected buy the outcome?

Check how many R's any individual has to see if the workload is out of balance.

==If a project is small enough with a small number of stakeholders and fairly defined roles, making a RACI chart may be unnecessary and counterproductive.

Projects can fall through for a number of reasons...
- unclear expectations
- unrealistic expectations
- miscommunication
- lack of resources
- scope creep
You'll want to clarify each of these areas upfront to avoid pitfalls. *But even if you do fail or fall short of expectations, it is an opportunity to learn and improve!
