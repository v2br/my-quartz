Risk management is typically involves some variation of these five steps:
1. Identify the risk.
    
2. Analyze the risk.
    
3. Evaluate the risk.
    
4. Treat the risk. 
    
5. Monitor and control the risk.

When identifying risks, it is important to also consider the good things that could happen, which are considered **opportunities**. An opportunity is a potential positive outcome of a risk.

### **Types of Common Project Risks**

1. **Time Risks**
    
    - Tasks may take longer than expected.
        
    - Poor time management can cause delays and overspend the budget, upsetting stakeholders.
        
    
2. **Budget Risks**
    
    - Arise from poor planning or scope expansion.
        
    - Overspending may prevent you from paying suppliers and harm your company’s reputation.
        
    
3. **Scope Risks**
    
    - The project may fail to meet goals or stakeholder expectations.
        
    - Deliverables might be unsatisfactory, undermining the project’s purpose.

### **External Risks**

- Outside the organization’s control, such as:
    
    - **Environmental risks** (e.g., storms)
        
    - **Legal risks** (e.g., new regulations)

### **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**

- A single issue that halts all project progress.
    
- Example: A power outage takes down a critical internal database.
    
- **Mitigation**: Use backup solutions (e.g., cloud storage) and monitor potential SPOFs carefully.

### **Dependencies**

- Tasks that rely on the completion or start of other tasks.
    
- **Risk Example**: Hiring a supplier is delayed, causing project delays.
    
- **Solution**: Track team schedules, plan for absences, and create contingency plans.

## Advantages of the Ishikawa Diagram

1. **Visual and easy to understand** Its fishbone-like structure allows for a clear and organized graphical representation of the causes of a problem. This makes it easy to understand even for people without technical experience.
2. **Encourages teamwork** It is an ideal tool for group brainstorming sessions. It allows team members to contribute different perspectives, enriching the analysis and improving the identification of causes.
3. **Organizes causes in a logical way** It groups causes into categories (such as the 5Ms or 4Ss), allowing the problem to be analyzed from different angles. This structure helps quickly identify critical areas within the process.
