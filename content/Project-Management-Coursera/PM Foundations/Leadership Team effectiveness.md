- Teams are composed of individuals with different motivators, so understanding each person helps managers inspire them effectively.
    
- Google’s research identified **five key factors for team effectiveness**, in order: **psychological safety, dependability, structure & clarity, meaning, and impact**.
    
- **Psychological safety** is the most important factor — teammates feel safe taking risks, sharing ideas, and resolving conflicts without fear of embarrassment or judgment.
    
- **Dependability** means team members reliably deliver work on time; managers must clearly communicate expectations and foster open negotiation around priorities.
    
- **Structure & clarity** ensure each person understands their role, goals, and how their work contributes to the team; strong project tracking supports this.
    
- **Meaning** comes from finding personal purpose in work, whether financial, team-oriented, or mission-driven.
    
- **Impact** is the belief that one’s work creates meaningful change, reinforced by tracking progress and showing how tasks advance larger goals.
